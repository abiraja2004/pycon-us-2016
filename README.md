### Draft notes/plan

Doing Math with Python

Slide #0:  A proposal

- Why *I* think this is a good idea?

Slide #A: Python - a scientific calculator

- Python 3 is my favorite calculator (not Python 2 because by default / is an integer!)
- BEDMAS, sin, cos, pi
- Fahrenheit, celsius, conversion
- Correlation, statistical measures
(making your functions already available when Python prompt started)

Set PYTHONSTARTUP to a Python file and all your functions will be available

For IDLE, start with "idle3 -s"

Slide #B: Python - a really fancy calculator

- SymPy (solving equations, plotting graphs of functions/expressions, differential and integration problems)
- Optimization
- SymPy + hill climbin
- CSV data

Slide #C: Bringing Math (and other subjects) to Life

- Create graphs and animations
- Drawing fractals (interactive notebook)
- Have fun: Write your own guess the correlation game
- Anscombe's quartets
- Why limit to Math and Science? Plotting geospatial data (basemap)

Slide #D: Perfect way to explore the future

- TODO: Demo of using Gradient descent for a regression/prediction problem's solution (predict the college admission based on high school math score)
- TODO: digit recognition

  https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/06/24/gradient-descent-linear-regression/
- NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, pandas..
